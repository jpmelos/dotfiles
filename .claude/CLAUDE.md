- The project root is *always* the current working directory.
- When citing path to code, *always* use paths *relative* to the project root.
  If applicable, mention the most relevant lines of code.
- When writing comments, *always* use complete punctuation. For example,
  *always* end phrases with a period (full stop), even at the end of comments.
- Use the command line `gh` tool to browse GitHub when working with GitHub URLs
  or working with GitHub repositories. When needed, check the Git remotes to
  see if you're working with a GitHub repository.
- Never directly run any default development tools from the repository like
  test runners or `pre-commit`.
